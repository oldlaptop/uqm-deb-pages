		<h1>UQM Debian packages - Building from source</h1>

		<p>
			I provide packages only for Debian Stable and the current Ubuntu biannual/LTS
			releases, on i386 and amd64, for now. If you use a different architecture (such
			as ARM or kfreebsd-foo) or a different distribution (such as Debian Testing, or
			some Debian derivative), you will need to build your own binaries from the
			source packages. A short howto:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Install the following packages:<br>
				<tt>build-essential debhelper cdbs libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev zlib1g-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libmikmod2-dev</tt>
			</li>

			<li>
			Download all files under 'Source' from the userfriendly download page at
			http://plantmonster.servebeer.com/~oldlaptop/uqm-packages/deb/uf/ (the tool
			dget(1) from the package devscripts can help with this).
			</li>

			<li>
			Extract each source package with <tt>dpkg-source -x [file.name.here.dsc]</tt>
			(dget(1) does this for you).
			</li>

			<li>Enter each newly unpacked source directory (e.g. uqm-0.7.0) and run
			<tt>dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc</tt>.
			</li>

			<li>You now should have one or more .deb packages one level above the source tree,
			which you can install with <tt>dpkg -i [package.deb]</tt>.
			</li>

			<li>Finally, note that, while you really should build all packages on your distro,
			you will probably be able to get away with skipping uqm-content and instead
			using the content .debs available here. If this causes problems, build the
			packages yourself before complaining :).
			</li>
		</ol>
