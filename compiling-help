UQM Debian packages

I provide packages only for Debian Stable on i386 and amd64 for now. Testing/Unstable
or Ubuntu users, or those using a different architecture (e.g. amd64, ARM, exotic stuff)
should download and build the source packages. A short howto:

* Install the packages:
  build-essential debhelper cdbs libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev zlib1g-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libmikmod2-dev

* Download all files under 'Source' from the userfriendly download page at
  http://plantmonster.servebeer.com/~oldlaptop/uqm-packages/deb/uf/ (the tool dget(1)
  from package devscripts can help with this)

* Extract each source package with 'dpkg-source -x <file.name.here.dsc>' (dget(1) does
  this for you)

* Enter each newly unpacked source directory (e.g. uqm-0.7.0) and run
  'dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc'.

* You now should have one or more .deb packages one level above the source tree,
  which you can install with dpkg -i <package.deb>.

* Finally, note that, while you really should build all packages on your distro,
  you will probably be able to get away with skipping uqm-content and instead using
  the content .debs available here. If this causes problems, build the packages
  yourself before complaining :).
